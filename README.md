# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This repository contains several fundamental implementations of convolutional neural networks 
Convolutional Neural Network takes advantage of picture structure, resulting in a sparse connection between input and output neurons. In  CNN, each layer conducts convolution where the RGB image is fed into the CNN as an image volume. In general, CNN takes an image as an input and apply a kernel/filter on it to produce the output. CNN also allows parameter sharing between output neurons, which indicates that a feature detector that works well in one region of the image will likely work well in another region of the image.
